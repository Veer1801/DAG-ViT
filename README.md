# DAG-ViT: Mathematical Formulation

This repository contains the **mathematical formulation** of **DAG-ViT (Directed Acyclic Graph Vision Transformer)** — a novel architecture that combines adaptive token selection with DAG-based relational reasoning to improve image understanding tasks.

## 📄 Paper Overview

> Traditional Vision Transformers (ViTs) rely on uniform token grids and lack relational context between patches. DAG-ViT introduces:
>
> - 🔍 **Adaptive Tokenization** via soft attention
> - 🔁 **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)** to model inter-token dependencies
> - 🧠 **Hybrid Reasoning** using GNNs and Transformers
> - ⚖️ **Differentiable DAG Loss** to ensure acyclic structure

The approach is especially useful in **medical imaging**, **satellite analysis**, and other tasks where spatial relationships and interpretability matter.
